I currently work as a Software Engineer for Google under the Core Systems organisation
where I primarily design and build backend systems to support people ranking/suggestion models
(e.g. Gmail recipient autocomplete, Google Docs plus mention suggestions, GSuite Sharing suggestions, etc.). I have also contributed to both Android and Javascript
data layer components, and a Google wide caching service.


I find myself interested in the mathematical concepts associated with computer
science and enjoy writing performance sensitive backend/library code (although,
I try to at least get my feet wet in a little bit of everything). My language of
expertise is C++, but I am proficient in most mainstream programming languages
(Java, Python, Go, Javascript, etc.). In my free time I enjoy reading, hiking,
and listening to and playing rock music.
