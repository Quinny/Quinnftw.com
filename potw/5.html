Most of the time the POTW's are pretty original.  A lot blood sweat and tears go into building up an elaborate story around a useful programming concept that was passed over by the educational system.  But sometimes Quinn gets lazy and heads over to reddit for some inspiration.<br /><br />
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a> is usually pretty useful, as it contains a slew of frequently updated problems that are marked with a difficulty tag.  Quinn browses the front page, skimming the titles for something that piques his interest.  Help automate this process by utilizing the reddit API.
<br />
<hr />

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the reddit API, it follows a very simple format:<br /><br />
Append <code>.json</code> or <code>.xml</code> (for all you masochists)  to the end of any URL to get the data in the corresponding format.

Develop a tool which utilizes the reddit API to generate suggested POTW's. Be creative, don't just pick the top post.
<br /><br />

Suggested Ideas:<br />
<ul>
<li>Develop an ML model trained on previous weeks question texts / topics.</li>
<li>Allow for a keyword to be entered and rank the problems based on their TF-IDF score</li>
<li>Develop a custom scoring function based on the difficulty tag, number of upvotes, etc.</li>
</ul>
