    Typing in 21 a&#39;s and a newline for both the username and input will first modify
    the max_password_len variable to be 3494793310839504916,
    causing fgets() to basically just read until a newline,
    so it&#39;ll also overflow its buffer and set authenticated to 3494793310839504896.
    Then the if statment checking authenticated will evaluate to true and give us admin access.


Yes you can.


There are a few system dependant things you&#39;d have to worry about,
such as the size of an int and the way data is arranged.

For our purposes we&#39;ll assume that int&#39;s are 4 char&#39;s long. 
The exact size of a char is also system dependant but usually 1 byte, which is usually 8 bits.

We&#39;ll also assume that data in the function is laid out in the same order as in the source code,
and that it is laid out with no extra space between variables or arrays.
But the data could be laid out to start at word boundaries,
or perhaps have had its order randomized for security reasons.


Now that we&#39;ve assumed all that we can look towards our goal of gaining admin access.

Basically what we want to do is go down a certain branch of execution,
one which it should only be possible to go down if we knew the password.
But going down that branch isn&#39;t decided directly by inputing the correct password,
but by the authenticated variable, which is set to be a truthy value by a branch
that compares the inputed password and the actual password.

But if we can find some way to modify the authenticated variable other than
knowing the password we will be able to access our desired branch.

A common way to do such things is to take advantage of input functions 
that don&#39;t limit the amount of input that they will read in,
leaving open the possibilty of reading in more data then memory
that had been reserved to store the input (the buffer).
A shitty input function will then begin writing input data
into memory meant for other things, creating a way for malicious users to
modify memory after a buffer however they&#39;d like.


You&#39;ll notice that the authenticated variable is right after the password buffer,
which could present us an oppurtunity to overflow the buffer and make authenticated a truthy value.
But buddy was clever enough to use an input function that will only read in a certain number of bytes.

Not clever enough to only use such input functions though.
Earlier he uses scanf, which will keep reading input until it hits a newline,
and conveniently reads it into a buffer preceding the rest of his data.

In theory we could craft a username that would perfectly overwrite the data in such
a way that we&#39;d get admin access, but there&#39;s a lot of data in between 
the buffer and the authenticated variable we&#39;re interested in,
so the username would have to be very long and we&#39;d have to be very careful
to not crash the program at some point.

Instead we&#39;ll just modify the max_password_len variable,
letting us overflow the password buffer and make authenticated non-zero.

Typing in 21 a&#39;s and a newline for both the username and password will first modify
the max_password_len variable to be 3494793310839504916,
as the most signifigant byte of the int will now be the ascii code for a.
At this point fgets() is basically just reading until a newline,
so fgets() will also overflow its buffer and set authenticated to 3494793310839504896.
Then the if statment checking authenticated will evaluate to true and give us admin access.

To be less conspicuous, any username and password between 20 and 24 characters long should work.
(With inputs that are too long we might risk crashing the program.)

        <pre><code>Since scanf will happily read characters until a new line appears, it is possible
to overflow the &#34;name&#34; buffer.  Fortunately, the &#34;max_password_len&#34; variable appears
immediately after said &#34;name&#34; buffer in memory. This means that one could increase
the value of the &#34;max_password_len&#34; variable by overflowing the name buffer.

Now that &#34;max_password_len&#34; has become some arbitrarily large value, the following
call to fgets (which was supposed to protect against buffer overflow) will read
a virtually unbounded amount of bytes into the &#34;password&#34; buffer. Overflowing the
password buffer will modify the value of the &#34;authenticated&#34; flag, thus providing
access into the system without knowing the password.

located right next to each other in stack memory) and will change 
the contents of the &#34;secret&#34; array to just be null characters. When you 
get to the part where you insert the password, just input nothing (press enter
in terminal while program is running). 

TL;DR: modify the secret array with buffer overflow to a string of

        <pre><code>Yes, you can gain admin access without entering the correct password.
This is due to the fact that the &#34;secret&#34; string is stored in memory following the &#34;name&#34; string,
and since you can enter a string of any length as a name, despite &#34;name&#34; being limited to 20
characters, you can enter 20 characters as name, and then continues to enter characters to overwrite
the &#34;secret&#34; string to be any string. This allows you to change the password and thus gain access
without entering the correct password.

Now, since we have increased the value stored at max_password_length, we can read in a password that is larger than 20 bytes. This again will overflow into the authenticated value and set it.
