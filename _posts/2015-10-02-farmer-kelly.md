## The Problem

Given an `M` x `N` matrix of integers, find the sub rectangle such that the sum is maximized.

## Example
<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/potw/matrix.png">
</div>

## Things to consider

* Negative values may appear in the matrix
    * If all values were positive the maximum sum sub rectangle would be the entire matrix
* There is a better solution than checking every sub rectangle

## Data representation

* Nothing overly complicated needed
* A 2D array will represent the data exactly as needed
* Usually easier to use a vector\<vector\<T\>\> in C++ v.s. T[][] as passing 2D arrays with run 
time sizes into functions is a little awkward

## The Idea

* We can solve the one dimensional version of this problem in linear time using kadanes algorithm
* The rows of the 2D array can be flattened into a 1D array by summing them together
* We can then perform kadanes algorithm on the flattened rows and find the rows bounding the 
maximum sub sequence

## One Dimensional Algorithm

* In order to find the row bounds we need to implement the one dimensional maximum sub sequence algorithm
* Known as Kadane's algorithm, it goes as follows:
    * Keep track of the sum of the current prefix that we scanned 
    * If that prefix ever becomes negative, give up on it and start over
    * After each iteration, compare our current prefix sum with the max seen so far
        and update accordingly

## Using this algorithm

* To use this algorithm, we simply need to iterate through the matrix fixing the columns
* We can then flatten the elements in between our fixed left and right columns into a one dimensional array
* Once we have our flattened columns, we run the result through kadanes algorithm and recieve the maximum sum 
as well as the bounding rows
