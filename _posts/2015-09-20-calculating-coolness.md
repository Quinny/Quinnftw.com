## The Problem

Given a list of friendships, calculate the degrees of separation between each person listed and
the coolest guy around Quinn

## Step 1: Data Representation

- Often the hardest part of solving any problem
- Very cruicial to the rest of your approach
- Should be well thought out
- The more problems you do, the easier this becomes

## Undirected Graphs

- We will represent the data given to us as an undirected graph
- What is a graph?
    - Not your typical line or bar graph
    - Graphs in math are defined as a 2-tuple (V, E)
    - A set of vertices connected by a set of edges
- Each person will be a vertex in our graph and each friendship will be an edge
- Undirected just means that each edge is bidirectional (just like the friendship relation)

## Step 2: Choosing an Algorithm

- Now that we have decided on a way to represent our data, we must choose an algorithm to process it
- Since we have decided to use a graph, it would only make sense to consider graph algorithms

## Breadth First Search

- *Breadth first search* is a commonly used algorithm for traversing graphs
- Useful for this problem because it traverses the graph in a *level order manner*
    - It first handles the root (Quinn)
    - Then moves to Quinn's direct neighbours (QDist level 1)
    - Continuing down until each level has been processed

## Step 3: Implementation

- Now that we have our data structure and algorithm mapped out, we can begin implementing them

## Graph Implementation

- Most languages *do not* include a graph data structure in the standard library
- Thankfully they are relatively simple, and most languages *do* provide the tools nessesary to do so
- Generally implemented using a map
- We map verticies to a list of their corresponding adjacent verticies

- Not the only way

## Breadth First Search and Cycle Detection

- Breadth first search is also relatively easy to implement
- One thing to keep in mind is that cycles may appear in the graph
- For instance:
    - ![]({{site.file}}/images/potw/cycle.png)

## Breadth First Search and Cycle Detection

- To handle this we simply need to make sure we do not visit any vertex more than once
- Each time a node is visited add it to a set of visited nodes
- Do not process any node that has already been visited

## Putting it all together

- We now have a map that maps each person to their QDist value
- Basically done at this point, we just need to handle the uncool people
- Since there does not exist a path in the graph from them to Quinn, they will not appear in the visited map
- This can be solved many different ways
- You could store all the names at the very beginning and then check which do not appear in the visited map
