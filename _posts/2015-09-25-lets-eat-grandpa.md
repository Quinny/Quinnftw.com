## The Problem

You are given a dictionary of words, followed by a list of sentences which have been 
stripped of all punctuation.  You are to determine if spaces can be re-inserted into 
the sentences such that each word created appears in the given dictionary.

## Things to consider

* Words may overlap
    * i.e. "cat" and "catch"
    * Where you choose to insert the space is important in this case
    * This prevents heuristic greedy algorithms
* A word may appear more than once in any sentence
* Test cases are large enough that computing all possible dictionary 
combinations will eat my CPU

## Things to consider 

* The key to this problem is finding all valid word prefixes for a given sentence
* Since words may overlap, we must explore each one

## Example
* Dictionary:
    * cat
    * catch
    * cha
* Sentence:
    * catcha
* You must consider the case of \[catch\]\[a\] and \[cat\]\[cha\]

## Data Representation

* Since we will be looking for valid word prefixes, this problem lends itself 
well to the *Trie* data structure (also known as a *prefix tree*)
* Trie's are ordered tree data structures which have the property that all 
descendants of a given node share a common prefix
* Used commonly for auto-complete and text prediction

## Implementation

* Like graphs, most languages do not include a trie structure in the 
standard library
* Again though, they are easily created using existing data structures
* Each node in the trie contains a map of a Character => TrieNode denoting an out 
going edge labeled with the character incident on the given TrieNode
* For the purpose of this problem we only need a minimal trie implementation
* insert, and prefixMatches are all that are necessary
* Note that tries can also be used to implement pattern matching i.e.
    * find all strings that start with a, followed by any 3 characters, and 
    end with b
    * These features are used for things like text prediction and auto complete

## Putting it all together

* Now that we have a way of finding all valid prefixes, we just have to design 
an algorithm to solve the problem
* Basically, for each valid prefix we find, we want to remove it from the sentence 
and then repeat the process with the remaining string
* Once we have exhausted the entire input string, we know that it was a valid sentence 
* Seems like a recursive problem
